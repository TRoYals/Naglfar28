Another lesson I learned early is that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market to-day has happened before and will happen again. I've never forgotten that. I suppose I really manage to remember when and how it happened. The fact that I remember that way is my way of capitalizing experience.

> 小本上记录的是我的预期正确的情况和错误的情况, 紧接在我对最可能出现的价格变化事前所做的判断之后。 我的主要用意是确认我的观察是否足够精准。 换句话说, 就是验证当初的预期是否正确。

我十分需要这样的一个小本子, 暂定为 [04 投资](../../03%20Life/04%20投资/04%20投资) 吧, 先有一个这样的记录的地方, 无论它有多简陋,这样才能养成 [习惯](原子习惯)
