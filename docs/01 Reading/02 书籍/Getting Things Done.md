概念提出 labeling ：
::: info

Here’s how I define “stuff”: anything you have allowed into your psychological or physical world that doesn’t belong where it is, but for which you haven’t yet determined what, exactly, it means to you, with the desired outcome and the next action step. The reason most organizing systems haven’t worked for most people is that they haven’t yet transformed all the stuff they’re trying to organize. As long as it’s still stuff, it’s not controllable.
:::

``Getting things done requires two basic components: defining (1) what “done”means (outcome) and (2) what “Getting” looks like (action). And these are far from self-evident for most people about most things that have their attention.``

Horizontal and Vertical Action Management  
Horizontal control maintains coherence across all the activities in which you are involved.  
Vertical control, in contrast, manages thinking, development, and coordination of individual topics and projects.

### GTD 具体操作


::: info
We (1) capture what has our attention; (2) clarify what each item means and what to do about it; (3) organize the results, which presents the options we (4) reflect on, which we then choose to (5) engage with. This constitutes the management of the horizontal aspect of our lives, incorporating everything that we need to consider at any time, as we move forward moment to moment.
