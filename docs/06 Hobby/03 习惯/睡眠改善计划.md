[../../10IMYMEMINE/日记/2024-04-17 diary](../../10IMYMEMINE/日记/2024-04-17%20diary) 09-11 决定开启为期 21 天的睡眠改善计划  
真得救救自己了, 不然感觉自己照现在这个睡眠状态可能都活不过 30 岁.

Starting now, I will start my 21 day trends to improve my sleep,  
Situation Now:  
Since my first year as an undergraduate, my average sleep time has been below 7 hours per day. And for the past two weeks, my sleeping time has been under 6 hours, I have not experienced the pleasure from a good sleep in more than two months.  
Possible reason:
- unscheduled sleep routine: my bedtime was from 1 to 4 am and my average sleep duration is regular, around 6 hours.
- Overdose of melatonin: I am the kind of person who can fall asleep as soon as I get into bed, yet I still take melatonin for the sake of nothing.
- Overuse of screen: I use computer before my sleep everyday.  
Possible solution:
- track my sleep time, charge and wear my AppleWatch everyday
- keep a sleep routine: strictly limit my sleep time before 2am.
- do not use screen: than do what? read kindle seems a good alternative.  
SO here is the my checklist for the next 21 days:
- [ ] wear AppleWatch
- [ ] sleep before 2am
- [ ] do not use screen 1 hour before bedtime

今日は 10 時間寝ました。実際の睡眠時間は 8 時間で、少し気分が良くなりました。まだ眠れると思いますが、あまり眠りたくないかもしれません。
