I will briefly introduce the skill set I bring to this position, drawing from my internship experiences. During my first internship, I served as a backend engineer intern where my primary skills were Java and Python. Although most of my work focused on development, I gained experience with end-to-end testing frameworks like Selenium using Python. During my time at Softem Inc. in Japan, I took the initiative to create cross-language solutions using advanced AI models, which are crucial in todayâ€™s global tech landscape. My technical skills include Python and various front-end technologies, bolstered by a deep understanding of software quality assurance principles. Afterward, I returned to Yonyou to serve as a frontend engineer in a large-scale development team, where I realized the importance of testing. During this experience, I conducted frontend unit testing with Jest and managed workflows using Jira, which taught me how to hand over our work quickly and efficiently.
