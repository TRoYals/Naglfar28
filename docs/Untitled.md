uring this phase of my internship at Yonyou Network Technology, my primary task was to land
into the internship role smoothly while obtaining access to the company’s services and familiarizing
myself with the team’s architecture and my assigned responsibilities. The key focus during this
period was to quickly adapt to the work environment and clarify my specific tasks within the
department.
In the first phase of my work, I was primarily involved in familiarizing myself with the company’s
projects. I participated in the development of an internal project called the ”Implementation
Workbench,” which I was assigned to take ownership of during my internship.
One of my main tasks was to migrate the project from an independent Git branch to the
main branch used for project deployment, ensuring proper environment adaptation. This involved
thorough testing and ensuring that the project was integrated into the company’s broader system
infrastructure seamlessly.
Additionally, I had the opportunity to participate in the company’s 0715 version iteration during
the deployment phase of the project. Through this experience, I gained a deeper understanding
of the development processes at an internet company, including the versioning and release cycle
management.
This first stage of the internship allowed me to quickly adapt to the company’s workflow, take
ownership of a significant project, and contribute meaningfully to its development and deployment.
